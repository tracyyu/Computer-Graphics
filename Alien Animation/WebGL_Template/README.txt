The project is a animation that shows an animated spacship with two movable arms below it projecting an illuminating light onto the earth. Aroudn the house is a spike polygonal shape, which is supposedly produced from the spaceship. While there is a moon rotating in the background with a mountain landscaping. 

The functions are separated into each object they were displayed in the final animation. For each specific object that required certain action or motions are written into separate functions.

The Moon is texturized with a moon image and also rotates in relationto the animation time of the graphicsState. Similarly, with the spaceship in its movement of the glass, body, and arms. 

The Mountains are populated in a random fashion in the background to provide a mountain terrain landscape.

In moving the camera, I orginally lookedAt a location that shows the overall picture of the animation to show where all the objects are located. Then, the camera moves toward the spaceship and looks up at it, until it is whiten out by a white object signifying the end of the animation.

The spiked polygon is the object I created in the shape class using 36 different vertices and random lines of shading to show the different light effect on the object.
